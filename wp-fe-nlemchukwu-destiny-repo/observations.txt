I am to say that i am happy that i took part in this challenge, i learned differently,

This test was supposed to take few hours but it ended up taking a day plus because i didnt have internet subscription to install some dependencies that will keep the sass up and running.

Questions?

Well my one and only question is ,

When will i start?

Please forgive me but with the way i feel , i dont mind starting immediately, I need this job like my life depends on it, i have been out of job for a very long time and i need a job not just to make a living but also to have to work for a purpose, 
I need an environment where i will improve myself and my skills and also improve the company's productivity,
I dont mind working more than 40hours a week , please help me, I need this job.
